# Basic-Projectile-Motion
If you have ever wondered at what speed you can kick a soccer ball,
you can do some basic physics and math and find out easily.
First, you need to go to a place where you can kick the ball at an altitude above ground,
for example a cliff, a hill, or on top of a building and you will also need to bring a timer and a measuring tape. 
Now, to find out at what speed you can kick a soccer ball, you will need some information to calculate it.
Once you kick the soccer ball, you will need to time how long it takes to hit the ground,
and the horizontal distance from where you kicked it to where it hit the ground.
The mathematical formula to calculate the velocity is to take the distance and divide it by the time.
For example, if when you kicked the ball, it landed 10 meters away and it took 3 seconds to hit the ground.
Then the speed of the ball from your kick is 3.33 meters per second.

Now, letâ€™s say you did not have a timer, or you are having difficulty getting the exact time of when the ball hits the ground.
Then you can calculate the speed by knowing the horizontal distance from where you kicked the ball to where it hit the ground
and the height of the cliff or the building.
If the building is 44.1 meters tall and when you kicked the ball it landed 10 meters away.
The formula to calculate time is the square root of multiplying 2 times the height of the building divided by gravity.
Therefore, 2 times 44.1 meters is 88.2 (meters) and when you divide 88.2 by gravity which is 9.8 (meters per second square)
you will get 9 (seconds square). When you take the square root of 9, you get 3 seconds.
Now that you have your time (3 seconds) and your horizontal distance (10 meters),
you can calculate the velocity by dividing the distance by the time. 
The speed of the ball from your kick is 3.33 meters per second.
